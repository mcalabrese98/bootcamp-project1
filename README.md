# Correlation Between Economic Growth and Economic Freedom

## Overview

This project explores the relationship between economic growth and economic freedom using Human Development Index and GDP Per-Capita data. The analysis with the main data processing and visualization is done in the `project.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to determine if there is a significant correlation between the economic freedom of countries and their economic growth rates.

## Analysis Summary

The `project.ipynb` notebook contains the following sections:

1. **Data Import**: Retrieves data from relevant sources and loads it into the environment.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, formats data, and prepares it for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizes the data to identify trends and patterns.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Calculates the correlation between economic growth and economic freedom indicators.

### Results

- The correlation analysis indicates a moderate positive relationship between economic freedom and economic growth, suggesting that countries with higher economic freedom tend to have higher growth rates.
